# Block Dude

This project consists of a "Block Dude" game using Haskell and was the first project i made at Universidade do Minho. The game involves moving blocks and climbing to reach higher places, and required problem-solving skills and knowledge of functional programming.

The program allows for creation of maps based of user input, as well as random map creation. Additionaly, the program features a "bot" that solves any given map.


# Example of graphical representation: 

```bash
>>> Jogo [[Vazio,Vazio,Vazio,Bloco],[Vazio,Vazio,Vazio,Bloco],[Porta,Vazio,Caixa,Bloco],[Bloco,Bloco,Bloco,Bloco]] (Jogador (2,1) Oeste False)
    X
   <X

```

```bash
>>> Jogo [[Bloco,Vazio,Vazio,Vazio],[Bloco,Vazio,Vazio,Vazio],[Bloco,Vazio,Vazio,Porta],[Bloco,Bloco,Bloco,Bloco]] (Jogador (1,2) Este True)
